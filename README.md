# fullwidth

A collection of tiny command line scripts that convert their input into fullwidth characters. For some reason there's also a Java class in here that does the same thing. Why did I write that?

You could symlink these into your _/usr/local/bin_, or something. If you want to do that, I recommend using the Ruby versionâ€”it starts up fastest.
