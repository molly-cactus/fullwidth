# fullwidth

A collection of tiny command line scripts that convert their input into fullwidth characters. For some reason there's also a Java class in here that does the same thing. Why did I write that?

**Note:** This is an abandoned branch. I just liked the idea of keeping the Java version around. Just, y'know, out of sight.

You could symlink these into your _/usr/local/bin_, or something. If you want to do that, I recommend using the Ruby versionâ€”it starts up fastest.
